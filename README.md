Calculate the exam by Python without import any module

# The commands for view

Each line will have the following file format: We created a function called my_final_grade_calculation and then returned a dictionary to tell if a student was accepted. Each line will have the following file format... :
(name, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6, a1, a2, a3, a4, midterm, final)

# So that:
So that:
• The name is a string
• q1 to q6 test scores (integers).
• a1 to a4 are homework scores (integer values)
• midterm, the midterm score. (Integer)
• Final is the final exam score (integer)
For example, if the content of the file looks like the following:<br>
tom, 10, 20, 0, 100, 0, 100, 70, 80, 90, 0, 80, <br>
mary, 0, 50, 66, 40, 10, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 80, 85<br>
joan, 0, 80, 40, 10, 50, 60, 7, 80, 90, 0, 80, 5<br>

Note that there may be an additional space between inputs in each line.<br>
Your function must return a dictionary such as the following:<br>

Hints:<br>
• Two of the lowest scores must be scored and the average of the four remaining tests is 25% of the total score.<br>
• The lowest score of the assignment should be dropped and the average of the remaining three exercises is 25% of the total score.<br>
• The final exam and mid-term are each 25% of the total score.<br>
Calculate the total student scores and if the total score is greater than or equal to 60 (total grades> = 60) then the student will<br> succeed. Note that the keys (names) and values (acceptance or failure) of the dictionary should be in all lowercase letters with no spaces.<br>
Do not make any modules to solve this problem.<br>

<hr>

Note: The space next to the name should not be deleted, but the distance between the beginning and the beginning of the line should be deleted
